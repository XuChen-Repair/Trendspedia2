# Wiki XML Dumper

## Usage

Change the path_to_file in parser and run it.

## Specs
Tested locally on simple.wikipedia.org dump since
it follows the same format except that it's much shorter
(<500 MB). The parser never took more than 14 mb of RAM
during runtime and execution time to parse all pages and
revisions took 1 minute and 22 seconds.
